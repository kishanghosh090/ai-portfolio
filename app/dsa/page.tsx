        I&apos;ve been consistently practicing Data Structures and Algorithms,
        focusing a lot on trees, recursion, graphs, and moving from easy to
        medium problems on LeetCode. My goal is to make problem solving feel
        natural, not scary. Soon I&apos;ll plug in a live feed of my LeetCode
        progress here.
